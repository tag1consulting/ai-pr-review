# Architecture

The action is implemented in the **Python engine** (`ai_pr_review/` package), which runs
compute, agent dispatch, and VCS posting in a single process. See [Features](features) for
the v1.0.0 announcement and [Configuration](configuration) for configuration reference.

## Data flow

1. **action.yml** invokes `python3 -m ai_pr_review review`
2. **`ai_pr_review/review/runtime.py`** (`build_review_runtime`) resolves config, builds the VCS provider, fetches the last-reviewed SHA, computes the diff, detects languages, runs static analyzers, loads SARIF findings, and loads suppression rules
3. **`ai_pr_review/orchestrate.py`** (`run_review`) dispatches agent tiers in parallel, merges LLM and pre-computed findings, deduplicates, applies suppressions, and posts the summary and findings via the VCS provider client (all in one process)
4. Each agent prompt is composed at dispatch time by injecting shared trailers: a **governance preamble** (`prompts/_governance.md` — Asimov's Three Laws, severity calibration, verify-before-naming, secret redaction, maintainer-verdict obedience), a knowledge-cutoff guard, a findings-schema instruction, and optionally a code-suggestion addendum

## Dependencies

The action requires `jq`, `git`, `gh`, and `python3` — all pre-installed on standard GitHub-hosted runners.

The **container action** (recommended) ships all static analyzer binaries pre-installed at pinned versions — no runner setup needed. The **direct action reference** and **git submodule** paths do not install analyzer binaries; see [runtime dependencies](installation-direct-action#runtime-dependencies) for the optional install-in-workflow snippet.
