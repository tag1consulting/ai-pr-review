## What it does

On every push to a pull request, AI PR Review runs a roster of LLM agents and deterministic static analyzers against the diff, then posts a structured review — a summary comment plus inline findings with "Apply suggestion" buttons where applicable. It's incremental (subsequent pushes only review what changed), suppresses known false positives via a JSON rules file, and is designed to fail gracefully when a model times out or a scanner is missing. Runs on GitHub Actions, Bitbucket Cloud Pipelines, or GitLab CI/CD against Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

## Quick start

Get AI reviews on your PRs in two steps:

**1. Add your LLM API key** as a repository secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or the equivalent for your [provider](configuration)).

**2. Create `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml`** with this minimal workflow:

```yaml
name: AI PR Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          
      - uses: tag1consulting/ai-pr-review/container-action@main
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          pr-number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          base-ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}
          head-sha: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

That's it — reviews start firing on the next PR.

## What's new in v2.4.9

**Asimov's Three Laws are now stated explicitly in `prompts/_governance.md`, and a new rule ties the learning loop's recorded maintainer verdicts to real suppression behavior.** A follow-up security fix closes an injection path where an attacker-controlled file name could forge a second maintainer verdict inside the trusted feedback block, and a relevance floor keeps verdicts about unrelated files from being injected at all.

See [Features → v2.4.9](features#whats-new-in-v249) for details.

## What's new in v2.4.8

**A GitHub review that failed to post as an approval no longer silently posts as a plain comment while still claiming the PR was approved.** The review body is rendered before posting, and when GitHub rejected the approval request, the fallback-to-comment path left that misleading text uncorrected — with no signal anywhere that the approval never actually landed. Fixed with a visible in-body correction, a Checks-tab annotation on the underlying failure, and a workflow log / step summary that now report the event actually posted.

See [Features → v2.4.8](features#whats-new-in-v248) for details.

## What's new in v2.4.7

**Raised the `max_tokens_per_agent` default from 16384 back to 32768.** Claude Sonnet 5's adaptive thinking could exhaust the lower budget on thinking alone, leaving no room for output text. Also fixes the live-model canary's auto-filed issue mislabeling an API quota block as a model-behavior regression, and a bug that made `/ai-pr-review dismiss`/`false-positive`/`wont-fix` fail to locate a finding on a review approved with only Medium/Low findings.

See [Features → v2.4.7](features#whats-new-in-v247) for details.

**Opt-in capabilities** — three independent features, all default off, all require the Python engine (the default since v1.0.0):

- [Tree-sitter context enrichment](configuration#opt-in-capabilities) — inject symbol definitions referenced in the diff into agent prompts; reduces hallucinated "should check X" findings
- [SARIF 2.1.0 ingestion](static-analyzers#sarif-ingestion-capability-b) — merge findings from external scanners (CodeQL, Semgrep, Trivy, Bandit) into the same dedup/post pipeline as native analyzers
- [Learning loop](learning-loop) — reviewers post `/ai-pr-review false-positive | wont-fix | feedback` to persist verdicts to a dedicated git branch; future reviews see them as a `<repo-feedback>` block
